[^1]: I prefer to use salted butter.
[^2]: Natural peanut butter does not work well in this recipe.

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to `350 degrees`. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper or use
   a silpat liner.

2. In a large bowl (or bowl of a stand mixer) cream together the butter, brown
   sugar, and peanut butter until light and fluffy, about `2-3 minutes`.

> 2-3 minutes will seem like a long time to mix the sugars, peanut butter, and
> butter but it's really important to do it for about that long. The dough will
> be much lighter in color and look fluffy. That's when you know you have
> blended it long enough.

3. Mix in the egg and vanilla, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.

4. In a separate bowl, add the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, baking powder,
   and salt and whisk to combine.

5. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the flour mixture to the wet
   ingredients and mix until just combined.

6. Add the oats and chocolate chips. Mix on low speed just until dough is
   combined.

7. Use about `1-2 tablespoons` of cookie dough, and place on the baking sheets;
   they should look like golf balls.

8. Bake the cookies for `7-9 minutes` until the edges are just starting to brown
   and the top still looks slightly undercooked.

> The cookies don't spread much at all while baking. For more of a cookie shape,
> take the bottom of a glass cup and gently press down on the cookie a few
> minutes after they come out of the oven.

9. Remove from the oven and cool for `5 minutes` on the baking sheet before
   moving them to a wire rack to cool completely.
